# Create a method that takes an integer, and puts the integer from 1 to n. However
# if the integer is divisible by 3, it will print 'fizz'. If its divisible by 5, it will
# print 'buzz'. Finally, if its divisible by both 3 and 5, it will print 'fizzbuzz'
















# Solution
# def fizzbuzz(n)
#   i = 1
#   while i <= n
#     if (i % 5 === 0) && (i % 3 ===0)
#       puts "fizzbuzz"
#     elsif i % 5 === 0
#       puts "buzz"
#     elsif i % 3 === 0
#       puts "fizz"
#     else
#       puts i
#     end
#     i += 1
#   end
# end
